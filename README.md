## Introduction
This project analyzes diabetes prevalence using statistical methods to evaluate key demographic and clinical risk factors. It applies hypothesis testing and correlation analysis to assess the significance of variables such as age, sex, and glucose levels in diabetes diagnosis.

## Technologies
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Launch
To run the project:
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ximenaacanton/Diabetes-Risk-Analysis.git
2.	Install the required dependencies:
   pip install pandas scipy numpy matplotlib seaborn
3.	Run the Python script:
   python diabetes_analysis.py

## Scope of Functionalities
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarized dataset trends and visualized key variables.  
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducted t-tests and chi-square tests to identify statistically significant risk factors.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined relationships between glucose levels, HbA1c, and diabetes prevalence.  

## Examples of Use
- **Assess Diabetes Risk Factors**: Identify whether certain demographics or clinical measures increase the likelihood of diabetes.  
- **Confirm Statistical Significance**: Determine if variables like sex and age are truly predictive of diabetes diagnosis.  
- **Visualize Data Trends**: Generate plots for glucose levels and HbA1c distributions to support early detection strategies.
